Road to master Spring framework
This is the first example and covers the aspect of Inversion Control.

Inversion Of Control (IOC):

IoC is a design pattern that describes inverting the flow of control in a system, so execution flow is not controlled by a central piece of code. This means that components should only depend on abstractions of other components and are not be responsible for handling the creation of dependent objects. Instead, object instances are supplied at runtime by an IoC container through Dependency Injection (DI).

IoC enables better software design that facilitates reuse, loose coupling, and easy testing of software components.
